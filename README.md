# Chainlit-RAG
Welcome to my chainlit app

Here I decided to make a RAG system using chainlit, vllm, and llamaindex

To start please look in the guide file. There you will find information about how to set up and start
the RAG system I developed.

Two file will be included chainlit-vllm-guide which will contain information on basic program info/ installation,
and chainlit-ai-start which is for starting all of the background tasks.

Everything from here is open-source.

Enjoy and happy programing. 

:)
